_Need to install Pillow for images handling_  

    pip install pillow

_Module requests is for json\_request example_

    pip install requests

_Need tkcalendar to work with Calendar_

    pip install tkcalendar  

_To run Text to Speech_

    pip install pyttsx3
    sudo apt install libespeak1 espeak ffmpeg

_To play sound_

I tested pydub, but it doesn't have a stop() feature.  
I tested simpleaudio, but it doesn't have a pause() feature.
I checked musicplayer, but it is not maintained anymore.
I checked sounddevice, but it is too complex.
The easiest way is pygame, even though just playing sounds is not the objective.

    pip install pygame
